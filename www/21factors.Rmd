# Description of Factors

## Factor Summary

The total scoring combines the scores by species from each Factor using pre-defined weights for each Factor. The total scoring by species is calculated as:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{F}_s = w_c*c_s + w_r*r_s + w_t*t_s + w_d*d_s + w_o*o_s + w_b*b_s \\
+ w_h*h_s + w_e*e_s + w_n*n_s + w_a*a_s
\end{align}
$$

where $w$ is the weight applied to each Factor, $c$ is the commercial importance by species $s$, $r$ is the recreational importance by species $s$, $t$ is the tribal importance by species $s$, $d$ is he constituent demand or choke factor by species $s$, $o$ is rebuilding by species $s$, $b$ is relative stock status by species $s$, $h$ is harvest by species $s$, $e$ is ecosystem importance by species $s$, $n$ is new information available by species $s$, and $a$ is the assessment frequency by species $s$. The weights for each Factor are shown in Table 1.

```{r, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
library(gt)

weight <- data.frame(matrix(NA, 10, 4))
colnames(weight) <- c("Factor", "Notation", "Weight Notation", "Weight")

weight[1,] = c("Commercial Importance", "$c$","$w_c$", 0.21)
weight[2,] = c("Recreational Importance", "$r$", "$w_r$", 0.09)
weight[3,] = c("Tribal Importance", "$t$","$w_t$", 0.05)
weight[4,] = c("Constituent Demand", "$d$","$w_d$", 0.11)
weight[5,] = c("Rebuilding", "$o$", "$w_o$", 0.10)
weight[6,] = c("Relative Stock Status", "$b$", "$w_b$", 0.08)
weight[7,] = c("Fishing Mortality", "$h$", "$w_h$", 0.08)
weight[8,] = c("Ecosystem Importance", "$e$", "$w_e$", 0.05)
weight[9,] = c("New Information Available", "$n$", "$w_n$", 0.05)
weight[10,] = c("Assessment Frequency", "$a$", "$w_a$", 0.18)
